# Work-Day-Scheduler

The purpose of this simple calendar application is to allow users to save events for each hour of the day.  Users can add important events to a daily planner in order to effectively manage their time.


## Acceptance Criteria

When users open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  When users scroll down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.  When they view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.  When they click into a timeblock, they can enter an event.  When they click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.  When they refresh the page, the saved events persist.
